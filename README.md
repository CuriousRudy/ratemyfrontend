HireFox- RateMyFrontEnd

HireFox is a platform built for HR departments, designed to take the guesswork out of new hires.

By leveraging peer-reviews from coworkers, HireFox allows HR Managers and Recruiters unprecedented access to real, verifiable information about new employees BEFORE they start working! By giving this level of detail, Hiring Managers can see insights into a new employees ability to engage in new tasks, communicate with their superiors, and work together with their coworkers.

By using peer reviews, we get more honest feedback about performance, although it may include the drawbacks of being biased slightly, or subject to fake accounts being used to post negative reviews. To avoid this, we implement a unique registration code that will be verified by either a previous employers or a coworker, and be locked to that user once an account is created. HR staff will be able to look through records of employers to indicate which accounts may or may not be malicious.

HireFox will be built on React.js with a Rails backend API, for testing purposes. As testing moves forward, may consider switching to a different backend, and add flux/Redux to manage auth/validation of user information as well as Admin status and data.
